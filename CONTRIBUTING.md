3. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
4. **Follow coding standards** and write tests

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Create a branch** from `main`:

   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/bug-description
   ```

2. **Make your changes**:
   - Follow the coding standards
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Run tests and formatting**:
   ```bash
   # Format code
   poetry run black .
   
   # Run tests
   poetry run python -m pytest tests/ -v
   
   # Run type checking (if mypy is available)
   poetry run mypy monitor_app/ --ignore-missing-imports
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: brief description of changes"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**:

## üìè Coding Standards

### Python Code Style

We use **Black** for code formatting and follow **PEP 8** conventions.

#### Formatting
```bash
# Auto-format all code
poetry run black .

# Check formatting without changing files
poetry run black --check .
```

#### Code Quality Guidelines

1. **Use descriptive variable names**:
   ```python
   # Good
   user_email = "user@example.com"
   
   # Bad
   e = "user@example.com"
   ```

2. **Write docstrings for functions and classes**:
   ```python
   def create_user(name: str, email: str) -> dict:
       """Create a new user with the given name and email.
       
       Args:
           name: The user's full name
           email: The user's email address
           
       Returns:
           Dict containing user information
           
       Raises:
           ValueError: If email format is invalid
       """
   ```

3. **Use type hints** (when available):
   ```python
   def get_user_by_id(user_id: int) -> Optional[dict]:
       """Get user by ID."""
   ```

4. **Follow Flask conventions**:
   - Use blueprints for modular code
   - Handle exceptions appropriately
   - Use SQLAlchemy best practices

### Configuration Management

When modifying `monitor_app/config/config.py`:

1. **Add new settings at the end** of relevant sections
2. **Provide sensible defaults** for all settings
3. **Document new settings** in README.md
4. **Update tests** to include new configuration

### API Design Principles

1. **RESTful conventions**:
   - GET for retrieval
   - POST for creation
   - PUT for updates
   - DELETE for removal

2. **Consistent response formats**:
   ```python
   # Success response
   {"success": True, "data": {...}, "message": "Operation completed"}
   
   # Error response
   {"error": "Description of what went wrong"}
   ```

3. **Input validation**:
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Return meaningful error messages
   - Use appropriate HTTP status codes

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

Our test suite includes:
- **Unit tests**: Individual functions and methods
- **Integration tests**: API endpoints and database interactions
- **Configuration tests**: Settings validation

### Writing Tests

1. **Test file location**:
   ```
   tests/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_api.py        # REST API tests
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_app.py        # Web application tests
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_config.py     # Configuration tests
   ```

2. **Test naming convention**:
   ```python
   def test_create_user_success(self, client):
       """Test successful user creation."""
   
   def test_create_user_invalid_email(self, client):
       """Test user creation with invalid email."""
   ```

3. **Use descriptive assertions**:
   ```python
   # Good
   assert response.status_code == 200
   assert "success" in response_data
   assert response_data["data"]["name"] == "John Doe"
   
   # Avoid
   assert response.status_code == 200 and "success" in response_data
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
poetry run python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
poetry run python -m pytest tests/test_api.py -v

# Run specific test class
poetry run python -m pytest tests/test_api.py::TestUsersAPI -v

# Run with coverage
poetry run python -m pytest tests/ --cov=monitor_app --cov-report=html
```

### Test Requirements

- **All new features** must include tests
- **Bug fixes** should include regression tests
- **Tests must pass** before PR approval
- **Maintain high test coverage** (aim for >90%)
